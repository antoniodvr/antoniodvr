### Hi, I'm Antonio 👋🏼 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a software architect who is passionate about making world more accessible, creating technology and improving everything I get in touch. I'm focusing on the use of microservice architectures and experimenting a way to turn coffee ☕ into code 😜!

I like computers, photography, music, dogs and traveling to discover the world 🌍.
